   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   npm install
   ```

   ```


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js + Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js

- **Database:** MongoDB
  
## How It Works

1. **Demo Trading Experience:** Once users create an account, they will receive virtual assets to begin trading. They can perform all standard Degen trading activities like buying, selling, and adding liquidity without any financial risks.

2. **Fetching Real-Time Data:** Using the Solana API, we fetch real-time token data to simulate actual market conditions, ensuring the trading environment is as close to real-life as possible.

3. **Leaderboard:** Users can participate in demo trading competitions, where the leaderboard tracks and ranks the most successful demo traders. Prizes are awarded based on performance.

4. **Token Swapping:** We have integrated demo token swaps that mimic the behavior of decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like Uniswap or SushiSwap. This allows users to practice making trades and managing liquidity pools in a safe environment.
